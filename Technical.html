<p id="second">Duel Brawlers is a 2D, top down, 1v1 shooter. The game must be<br> played with another player locally.
    The game is being developed<br> in phaser and will be playable on any of our 3 online websites.<br> This means the game is also strictly pc however we do aim to<br> implement controller support.
    The players are pit against each<br> other with identical starting weapons and symmetrical cover<br> The maps are designed this way so that no one player has an<br> advantage.</p>
<p id="Paragraph2">Each round is a short 1v1 local multiplayer match. The last player<br> standing wins
    the round. If the timer runs out and both players are still<br> alive the round is a draw. During each round, the player will be able to<br> hide behind objects to
    prevent damage, however, various pickups will<br> spawn near the middle of the map, thus giving each player a choice on<br> whether they want to play it safe,
    or go for the items that spawn. Each<br> additional weapon the player picks up will have limited ammo,
    and the<br> player will automatically swap back to their starting weapon once they<br> have run out.
    Health packs and speed boosts will also be available<br> throughout the rounds, which will last a limited amount of time.</p>
<p id="Paragraph3">When designing map layouts for the game we decided to try to keep it<br> symmetrical. This is mostly to keep the playing field even for both<br> players. While it's not 100% identical on both sides, the spread of cover<br> and general design is symmetrical, this is just to keep the map design<br> interesting and aesthetically pleasing.
    There will be cover for each<br> player to use on both sides of the map, the cover itself will be the exact<br> same as the opposite. However, items spawned in are random and may<br> appear on one side of the map, closer to player 2 as an example.
</p>
<p id="Paragraph4">Each player will have a health bar at the top of the screen. This<br> healthbar will match the colour of the player, thus avoiding potential<br> confusion. There will also be ammo counters at the bottom of the screen<br> also in the same colour as the player.
    The ammo counter will represent<br> the max ammo you have and your current clip i.e 20/80, 20 in the<br> current clip, 80 in total.
</p>

<p id ="Paragraph5">Perspective of the level - Being able to see where each other is on the map at all times<br><br>
    Cover System - Each player will be able to hide behind cover to stop incoming fire<br><br>
    Item pickups - Each round, multiple items will spawn randomly in the map, this can<br> include more powerful weapons, health pickups or speed pickups<br><br>
    Round System - There will be 6 rounds for both players to circumvent. There can be draws,<br> so the game can last as much as 6 rounds in total, or 4 if one of the players wins 4 in a row<br><br>
    Ammo Counters - For each of the weapons the player is able to pick up, an ammo counter<br> will be present. This will be in the form of X/Y, with X being the current clip and Y being the<br> full amount of ammo you have<br><br>
    Health-Bar - Each player will have a health bar that will go down everytime they are hit,<br> this health-bar will represent each player by being the same colour as their character, thus<br> avoiding confusion.</p>
